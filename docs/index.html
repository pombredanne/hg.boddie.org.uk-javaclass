<h1>javaclass</h1>

<p>The javaclass collection of packages and utilities (also known as
ClassFile) provides a means of importing Java classes and packages directly
into Python, without the need for a Java virtual machine, so that the classes
may be instantiated, accessed, run and manipulated just like Python classes,
and that the resulting objects and methods can be accessed and manipulated
just like Python objects and methods. It should be possible to run compiled
Java programs with the Python interpreter and not notice that it isn't the
Java virtual machine being used - given sufficient library support for the
program concerned, of course.</p>

<h2>Quick Examples</h2>

<p>It can be quicker to see what this is about by seeing some examples.</p>

<h3>The Not Very Convincing Example</h3>

<p>You can run Java classes by finding one with a main method and executing
it. Here's a comparison of a freshly prepared Java class being run in Python
and in a Java virtual machine:</p>

<p class="prompt">cd tests/</p>

<p class="prompt">javac Value.java</p>

<p class="prompt">runclass.py Value</p>

<p class="result">v.getValue() correct: 123<br />
v.getValue() correct: 456<br />
v.isPositive() correct: 1<br />
v.isPositive() correct: 0<br />
v.compare(-790) correct: -1<br />
v.compare(-788) correct: 1<br />
v.compare(-789) correct: 0<br />
v.getValue() == v2.getValue() correct: 0<br />
v2.add(-123) correct: 0<br />
v2.getValue() correct: 255</p>

<p class="prompt">java Value</p>

<p class="result">v.getValue() correct: 123<br />
v.getValue() correct: 456<br />
v.isPositive() correct: true<br />
v.isPositive() correct: false<br />
v.compare(-790) correct: -1<br />
v.compare(-788) correct: 1<br />
v.compare(-789) correct: 0<br />
v.getValue() == v2.getValue() correct: false<br />
v2.add(-123) correct: 0<br />
v2.getValue() correct: 255</p>

<h3>The Slightly More Credible Example</h3>

<p>It can be more interesting to get into Python's interactive mode and then
start playing around with Java classes:</p>

<p class="python-result">Python 2.2.2 (#2, Jan 21 2005, 16:16:57)<br />
[GCC 2.96 20000731 (Red Hat Linux 7.3 2.96-112)] on linux2<br />
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.</p>

<p class="python-prompt">import javaclass.classhook</p>

<p class="python-prompt">from __this__ import Value</p>

<p class="python-prompt">dir()</p>

<p class="python-result">['Value', '__builtins__', '__doc__', '__name__',
'javaclass']</p>

<p class="python-prompt">dir(Value)</p>

<p class="python-result">['__class__', '__delattr__', '__dict__', '__doc__',
'__getattribute__', '__hash__', '__init__', '__init______I_', '__module__',
'__new__', '__reduce__', '__repr__', '__setattr__', '__str__', '__weakref__',
'add', 'add____I_', 'compare', 'compare____I_', 'getClass', 'getClass___',
'getValue', 'getValue___', 'isPositive', 'isPositive___', 'main',
'main___java__lang__String_array_', 'newValue', 'newValue___', 'setValue',
'setValue____I_']</p>

<p class="python-prompt">v = Value(20050121)</p>

<p class="python-prompt">v.getValue()</p>

<p class="python-result">20050121</p>

<p class="python-prompt">v.setValue(20050401)</p>

<p class="python-prompt">v.getValue()</p>

<p class="python-result">20050401</p>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

<p>See the <code>README.txt</code> file in the distribution directory.</p>

<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Pick one of the following:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The need/desire to access Java libraries from Python without firing up
    Java virtual machines or switching to Jython (and thereby losing
    convenient access to various CPython libraries).</li>
  <li>Mixing languages available for the Java runtime with Python.</li>
  <li>Static typing for the Python environment, albeit achieved by writing
    Java or other appropriate languages.</li>
  <li>Having an open source environment from top to bottom to run Java
    bytecode on.</li>
  <li>Experimentation around import hooks, bytecode generation; observation
    of different runtime and type systems interacting.</li>
  <li>Making Python libraries available to Java programs - Tkinter for Java,
    anyone?!</li>
</ul>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>It isn't all great, however. Here are some reasons why this might not do
what you want it to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It runs on the Python runtime which does not have the security,
    threading and just-in-time compiler features that people enjoy about Java
    runtimes, so if what you like to do is to run one big servlet container
    with lots of classes and threads from different people floating around,
    this isn't going to protect them from doing all sorts of things to each
    other and to your system. However, you may take the unfashionable view
    that the operating system is supposed to do that kind of thing.</li>
  <li>It works by generating Python bytecode from the Java bytecode in class
    files (and .jar archives). Generally, anyone who is anyone in the Python
    pantheon has largely recommended against doing anything with the
    bytecode, despite noble efforts to make exciting things happen by
    transforming it, optimising it, and so on. (Instead, there's been more
    emphasis on lots of runtime baggage for things which could be done by
    analysis of the code with modified bytecode being produced as a result,
    and let's not get started on some of the syntactical enhancements.)
    Consequently, stability might be an issue for some configurations,
    especially since CPython doesn't fail particularly graciously with badly
    behaved bytecode.</li>
  <li>Some of the translation from Java to Python bytecode takes a few
    liberties. For example, Java exceptions are handled in ways reminiscent
    of a 1980s microcomputer assembly language, whereas Python bytecode has
    higher level constructs for exceptions; this translation can probably be
    done incorrectly, triggering some kind of bytecode misbehaviour, and we
    all know what happens then.</li>
  <li>At the Python level, not all things seem totally right. For example,
    Java bytecode instructions are used to instantiate and then initialise
    exceptions just like other objects, and while Python can support this
    with new-style objects, Python won't let you use new-style objects as
    exceptions. Consequently, when Java exceptions appear in Python programs,
    they will be wrapped in old-style exceptions and have to be handled
    specially.</li>
  <li>In order to support method dispatch properly, special names are used
    for the translated methods which include the type information found in
    the bytecode; things like <code>main___java__lang__String_array_</code>
    and <code>setValue____I_</code> appear when you look inside classes and
    objects. When implementing libraries in Python for Java programs, such
    method naming conventions have to be used because the original code is
    very specific about which method is being invoked, and for specialised
    versions of <code>__init__</code> it becomes necessary to do a
    <code>setattr</code> to add such methods into classes because of various
    "name mangling" measures in the Python compilation process. Now, many
    people might start advocating decorators at this point, but not everyone
    is running the very latest stuff from python.org, and decorators won't
    help you target a specific specialised method anyway.</li>
  <li>Imported and translated bytecode is not written out or cached. This
    means that a fair amount of work happens every time you need to import
    Java classes, although the generation of .pyc files could be introduced
    provided that it captured the slightly different import semantics of
    Java; for example, you can import classes belonging to a package from
    several places on the PYTHONPATH, and this is something that generally
    isn't allowed/supported with the classic Python module import
  mechanisms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Suggestions for Python Improvements</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Make the bytecode interpreter more robust when encountering badly
    behaved bytecode, consider bytecode verification and other exciting
    features.</li>
  <li>Allow new-style objects as exceptions. Actually, just do something
    about the whole old-style vs. new-style class thing!</li>
  <li>Allow possible optimisation for things like statically predetermined
    method calls. The debate about static typing intersects slightly with the
    need to define methods with parameters of particular types, but
    supporting Java-style method "coexistence" (or multimethods, or whatever
    the proper name is) would presumably involve doing lots of things to the
    language that were once thought to be highly un-Pythonic. Besides, the
    need to interoperate with statically typed languages shouldn't dictate
    the design of Python, especially if better type systems could be adopted
    instead, leaving the static typing glue for strictly special
  occasions.</li>
  <li>Not that threaded Java programs have been run on Python yet, but with
    Python's current threading architecture I'd expect some
  disappointment.</li>
</ul>
